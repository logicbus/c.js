c.js is a library that makes using the JavaScript console easier and more powerful. 

c.js is a JavaScript library. It is not a jQuery library and does not require jQuery. However, it is compatible with jQuery. 

In order to use c.js on your site, put a copy of the c.js file on your website and add a script tag to the page where you want to use it:

<script src='/c.js' ></script>

The first advantage c.js gives you is that instead of needing to type "console.log('foo')" a thousand times, you can type "c('foo')" a thousand times. 

The second advantage c.js gives you is that it is able to output arrays and objects in a useful way.  

The c() function accepts up to three parameters:

function c(value, label, inDisplay)

value is the value you want to output to the JavaScript console.  

label is a label you may want to output before the JavaScript console.  If you are passing many values to the console, it may be helpful to label them. 

inDisplay is used to control how multi-level objects are collapsed and expanded. (This uses console.group() and console.groupCollapsed().) Six values are specified, and any other value will be treated as default:

topexpanded  : The top level object is expanded and everything below it is collapsed.
topcollapsed : The top level object is collapsed and everything below it is expanded.
allcollapsed : All levels are collapsed. 
collapsed    : All levels are collapsed. 
allexpanded  : All levels are expanded. 
expanded     : All levels are expanded. 
other/blank  : All levels are expanded.
